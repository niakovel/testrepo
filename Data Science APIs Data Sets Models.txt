Community Data License Agreement - license for sharing of data vs software
	CDLA-Sharing: use and modify, publication under same terms
	CDLA-Permissive: use and modify, no obligation to share changes
	Neither places restrictions on results
	
IBM Data Asset Exchange
	Curated data sets for enterprise, with clear licenses
	Most data sets have associated Jupyter Notebooks
	
				Machine Learning Models
				
Training Types:
	Supervised Learning - data labeling for regression/classification(spam filter, images, fraud, etc.) problems
	Unsupervised Learning - data not labeled; clustering (recommendation service), anomaly detection (outliers e.g. suspicous logins), etc.
	Reinforcement Learning - Chess, Go, strategy games
	
Deep Learning
	Neural Networks - NLP, images, audio, time series forecasting, etc. 
	Requires large labeled data sets
	Implemented in frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
	Model Zoos are pre-trained frameworks, like the above and ONNX
